HiST-utils for Matlab
=====================

I do not expect these files work anymore, they haven't been used for a couple years. Just kept for reference.
If you need to access HiST or DMC data from Matlab, I suggest either calling Python from Matlab via ``py`` or just install 
`Miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_

It is good for your career to know at least a little Python in any rate.
